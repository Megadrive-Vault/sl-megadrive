# sl Megadrive

This is a port of [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) for Sega Genesis/Megadrive.
It does nothing except animate an ASCII art locomotive on the screen.

I created this as an exercice to learn how to output text on the Megadrive.

Most of the code comes from the original sl source code by Toyoda Masashi.
